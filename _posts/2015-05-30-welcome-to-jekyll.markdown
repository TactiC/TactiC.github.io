So, here it is. My first post on my new blog.
After using various blog frameworks (Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla) on both local and remote servers I decided to
do things different.
This site is nothing more than a bunch of plain text files in a git repository hosted on [Github][github-url].
The site itself gets generated by [Jekyll][jekyll-url].

No hassle with databases, just text files. Nice and simple just as I like it.
